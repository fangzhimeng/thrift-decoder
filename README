thrift-decoder - a small utility for analysing the structure of thrift packets

Given a file containing a single thrift message, thrift-decoder prints the id,
type and value for all fields within. This can be useful when analysing an
unknown protocol, to either reverse engineer it, or to recover its definitions
if they have been lost.


Known deficiencies

  * Some data types are not implemented: double, map, set, list, enum.
    I only implemented those that were immediately useful for me.
  * Lack of error handling. Malformed packets will likely crash thrift-decoder.

If you'd like to address one of the above issues, pull requests are welcome.
